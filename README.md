# Oscilator

The 555 is an integrated circuit that has several applications in electronics.

## Aplication
• Precision Timing
• Pulse Generation
• Sequential Timing
• Time Delay Generation
• Pulse Width Modulation
• Pulse Position Modulation
• Linear Ramp Generator

In this case, it was put in an astable configuration.

## Code
This algorithm calculates the resistors and capacitors (Commercial) that will be used in the above circuit. RA , RB and RC.
Just put the desired frequency in: frequencia (variable in the end of code).
